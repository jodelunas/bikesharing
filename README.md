By adding the map, this image shows that the most popular starting locations tend to be near public transportation. Most likely, all are high foot-traffic areas. Although, on a smaller scale, it would be important to look for these types of areas for stations in Des Moines.

### Top Ending Locations

The top ending locations follow the same trend, which will help with placement of stations.

This graph shows that a majority of users checkout bikes for around five minutes. This tells us that the need for destinations close to pick up are very important. Generally, bus and train stops need to be close to many destinations as well.

### Checkout Times by Gender

Male usage is the highest among users. There could be ways to close the gap with different advertisements or promotions, but work attire could be the factor here. 

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

This graph shows that while normal rush hour times are the most popular times during the week, weekends are busy as well. This makes it important to look for tourist and recreational areas as well. While it is very important to accommodate commuters, you can't forget about recreational riders.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

This heatmap shows the most popular times and days are the same for males and females. It matches with other charts that Monday thru Friday at rush hours are the most popular times. Unknown have a slightly heavier use on weekends.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

This heat map shows that male subscribers are the biggest market. The busiest days, being weekdays, shows that regular use is what interests people in subscriptions. The average customer is primarily using this service for recreation, not necessity.
