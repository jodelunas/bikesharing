## Overview

By adding the map, this image shows that the most popular starting locations tend to be near public transportation. Most likely, all are high foot-traffic areas. Although, on a smaller scale, it would be important to look for these types of areas for stations in Des Moines.

This graph shows that a majority of users checkout bikes for around five minutes. This tells us that the need for destinations close to pick up are very important. Generally, bus and train stops need to be close to many destinations as well.

Male usage is the highest among users. There could be ways to close the gap with different advertisements or promotions, but work attire could be the factor here.

This graph shows that while normal rush hour times are the most popular times during the week, weekends are busy as well. This makes it important to look for tourist and recreational areas as well. While it is very important to accommodate commuters, you can't forget about recreational riders.

This heatmap shows the most popular times and days are the same for males and females. It matches with other charts that Monday thru Friday at rush hours are the most popular times. Unknown have a slightly heavier use on weekends.

This heat map shows that male subscribers are the biggest market. The busiest days, being weekdays, shows that regular use is what interests people in subscriptions. The average customer is primarily using this service for recreation, not necessity.
